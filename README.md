Getting started with the code
Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:rycolab/transformer-ngrams.git
$ cd transformer-ngrams
```
It may be beneficial to create a new Python virtual environment (e.g., using conda). 
We aim at Python 3.10 version and above.

You can then install the package in editable mode:
```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

We use pytest to unit test the code.
You can run the tests with:
```bash
$ pytest tests/
```
